# Movie-DB
This project is a movie web-based application that resembles IMDB and implements a database to store content and load that content dynamically on the screens.  In this project, there will be two modules including one for the administrator and one for the general users of the system.  Through the administrator module, the user will be able to create, update, and delete data to and from the database.  In the general users module, users will be able to view all the database content including movies, the movie details, categories, genres, actors, and directors. Finally, the system will provide user authentication and will allow the user to login and logout of the system using sessions.
Overall, this project is designed using bootstrap, is developed using an object oriented approach, connects to a MYSQL database, performs CRUD operations, enables user registration and authentication, contains a simple search engine, and leverages AJAX.
